## Probabilities
Task: Throw a coin three times\
Outcomes: KKK, KZK

Ergebnis = Outcome\
Ereignis = Event

$P(Throw\ KKK) = (1/2)^3$\
$\Omega = \{KKK, KKZ, KZK, KZZ, ZKK, ZKZ, ZZK, ZZZ\}$\
$P(A) = P(A)/P(\Omega)$\
$P(A|B) = P(A\cap B)/P(B)$\
$P(Throw\ K\ twice) = 3/8$

Definition $\Omega$ and $2^\Omega$:\
$\Omega = \{0,1\}$\
$2^\Omega = \{\empty, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}$
